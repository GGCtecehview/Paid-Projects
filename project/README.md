# Custom Image Classification Project

Welcome to the custom image classification project designed Pranav Tanmay's Friend. This project combines the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction with the simplicity and effectiveness of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for image classification, showcasing a unique approach to classifying images with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To classify images using a hybrid approach combining CNN and KNN.
- **Technology Stack**: TensorFlow for CNN, Scikit-learn for KNN, and Pandas for data handling.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure your Python environment has TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and Pandas installed.
2. **Data Preparation**: The dataset is structured and accessed from Google Drive, demonstrating seamless integration with cloud storage.

## Implementation Details

- **CNN Model**: Custom-built with layers optimized for feature extraction, trained on a binary classification problem.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes the CNN model minus the final layers to extract meaningful features from images.
- **KNN Classification**: Applies KNN on extracted features for classification, highlighting a blend of deep learning and machine learning techniques.
- **Feature CSV Generation**: Extracted features and labels are saved into a CSV file, facilitating easy analysis and further machine learning applications.

## Usage

This project is structured to guide you through training the CNN model, extracting features, applying KNN classification, and generating a CSV of features. Follow the instructions in the code comments for a smooth experience.
